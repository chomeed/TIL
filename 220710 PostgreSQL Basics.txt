How to connect to my PostgreSQL database: 

Firstly, open up psql shell or pgAdmin interface, whichever way you prefer. 
Then enter the appropriate information as shown below. 
- server
- database
- port 
- username 
- password 

For the most of the time, PostgreSQL utilizes 5432 as its port number but I noticed that my docker container is using port number 7000. 
So for my case, I would type in 7000 for the port number. 

SELECT * FROM [TABLE NAME] 

The above statement will extract all the rows - in this case, each represents a piece of data - from the specific table you queried to.
